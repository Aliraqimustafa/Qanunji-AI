# Qanunji-AI 🤖

Welcome to Qanunji-AI, a repository where I present the source code and complete instructions to create a legal specialist using artificial intelligence. In this project, I've developed a chatbot with legal expertise, utilizing provided legal files for learning. The chatbot's knowledge is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 API. 🧠

I utilized the flet library, which offers a straightforward interface for creating Flutter applications using Python. Additionally, I incorporated the Google API GooglePalmEmbeddings to enhance the functionality. Below, you'll find a video demonstrating how this code operates. 🎥
