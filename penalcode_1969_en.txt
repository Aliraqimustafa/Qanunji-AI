Article 21 
1- A person shall not be asked about a crime that was not a result of their criminal behavior, but they shall be asked about the crime even if they contributed to it along with another pre-existing, concurrent, or subsequent cause, even if they were unaware of it.

Article 31 
It is the commencement of carrying out an act with the intention of committing a felony or misdemeanor, if it is stopped or fails for reasons beyond the actor's control. The attempt to commit a crime is considered every act undertaken with the intention of committing a felony or misdemeanor that is impossible to carry out due to a reason related to the nature of the crime or the means used to commit it, unless the actor's belief in the validity of their action to produce the result is based on deception or applied ignorance. The mere determination to commit a crime or preparatory acts for it are not considered attempts unless otherwise provided by law.

Article 31

Second section: Moral pillar
Criminal intent and mistake

Article 33
1 - Criminal intent is directing the perpetrator's intention toward committing the act constituting the crime, aiming at the result of the crime that occurred or any other criminal result.
2 - Intent can be simple or compounded with premeditation.
3 - Premeditation is the deliberate thought of committing the crime before its execution, away from sudden anger or emotional frenzy.
4 - Premeditation is satisfied whether the perpetrator's intent is directed at a specific person or an unspecified person whom he has encountered, and whether such intent is contingent upon an occurrence or conditional.

Article 34
The crime is intentional if criminal intent exists in its perpetrator, and the crime is also considered intentional.
A - If the law or agreement imposes a duty on a person and he intentionally refrains from performing it, thereby causing the crime that directly arises from such abstention.
B - If the perpetrator anticipates criminal consequences for his act and proceeds with it, thereby accepting the risk of its occurrence.

Article 35
The crime is non-intentional if the criminal result occurs due to the perpetrator's mistake, whether this mistake is negligence, recklessness, inattention, failure to take precautions, or failure to comply with laws, regulations, and orders.

Article 39
If the perpetrator is unaware of an aggravating circumstance that changes the description of the crime, he shall not be held accountable for it, but he may benefit from the excuse even if he is unaware of its existence.

Article 37
1 - No one can invoke ignorance of the provisions of this law or any other penal law unless he was unable to know the law punishing the crime due to irresistible force.
2 - The court may exempt from foreign punishment a person who commits a crime within a maximum of seven days from his arrival in Iraq, if it is proven that he was unaware of the law and the law of his place of residence does not punish it.Article 38:
The motive cannot be considered for committing a crime unless the law states otherwise.

Article 31:
There is no crime if the act is committed as a duty imposed by the law.

Article 41:
There is no crime if the act is committed by an employee or a person responsible for public service, in the following cases:
1- If the act is carried out with the intention of fulfilling what the laws have ordered or if it is believed that it is within his jurisdiction.
2- If the act is carried out by him in accordance with an order issued to him by his superior and he believes that obedience is his duty.
In both cases, it must be proven that the belief of the actor in the legitimacy of the act was based on reasonable grounds and that he did not commit it except after taking the appropriate precautions. However, there is no punishment in the second case if the law does not allow the employee to discuss the order issued to him.

2- The use of rights.

Article 41:
No crime is committed if the act is done in exercise of a right prescribed by law and it is considered the use of the right.

2- If it is impossible for him to resort to public authorities to avoid this danger at the appropriate time.
3- If he has no other means to avert this danger. This right is equal if the threat is directed to the defender himself, his property, or directed to a third party or his property.

2- Robbery crimes.
3- Entering a haunted house or one of its accessories at night.
4- An act that fears death or serious injury if there are reasonable causes for this fear.

Article 45:
The right to legitimate defense does not permit causing more harm than necessary for this defense. If the defender intentionally or negligently exceeds the limits of this right or mistakenly believes that they are in a state of legitimate defense, they will be held responsible for the crime they committed. The court is allowed in this case to rule a misdemeanor sentence instead of a felony sentence, and to rule a violation sentence instead of a misdemeanor sentence.

Article 49:

Article 91
A person who commits a crime while being in an unconscious state or lacking in will due to madness, mental disability, or being under the influence of intoxicants or narcotics administered to him by force or without his knowledge or for any other reason deemed by science to cause loss of consciousness or will at the time of committing the crime, is considered an excuse for mitigation.

Article 91
If the loss of consciousness or will is due to intoxicants or narcotics willingly consumed by the criminal and is aware of their effects, he shall be punished for the crime committed, even if it has a specific intent, as if it had been committed by him without being under the influence of intoxicants or intoxicated by alcohol.

Reasons
The Penal Code in effect in Iraq today was issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the British occupation forces in Iraq on November 21, 1927, to be implemented from January 1, 1925 (the Baghdad Penal Code). It was named so because it was implemented in the Baghdad state and then extended to other parts of Iraq later. When the first Iraqi constitution was issued in 1925, it granted all regulations, systems, and laws issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Iraq, including the Baghdad Penal Code, as well as those issued by the General Royal Governor and the British High Commissioner and the King's government. The constitution gave all of that the force of law, until it is replaced or canceled by the legislative authority (Article 114).Despite the explanatory memorandum that was published with the Baghdad Penal Code stating that this law was intended to be temporary and subject to review for complete revision when the necessary personnel are available and sufficient time is found, the law remained in effect without change. New provisions were added, existing provisions were deleted, and some were modified according to the terms of other laws that were issued in the interim period.

The Baghdad Penal Code was initially published and distributed in English, and there was no Arabic translation available for the first two years of its implementation. The first Arabic translation was published in 1121, and the courts, plaintiffs, legal scholars, and researchers found differences between various articles in the original English and the Arabic translation, resulting in changes in the meanings and rulings. The Ministry of Justice had to issue several bulletins at different times to correct some errors in the Arabic translation and requested that the texts be implemented in the corrected form.

As a result, the courts, plaintiffs, and the general public found themselves faced with three versions of the Penal Code: the English version in which the law was published, the first translation, and the corrected Arabic version. This led to the need to adopt a definite position by relying on one of these three versions and working accordingly. However, there was inconsistency among the judiciary, including the Court of Cassation, as well as the Ministry of Justice. At times, it was believed that in case of disagreement between the English and Arabic texts, the English version would prevail as the law was published in that language, and the Arabic translation was considered unreliable if it differed from the original English. Many decisions were issued by the courts, including the Court of Cassation, based on this approach. However, at some point, this view was abandoned, and it was recognized that the first Arabic translation was the binding official text that cannot be changed by anyone other than the legislator. Then, there was another shift back to the view that it is permissible to consider the corrected Arabic version when there is an error in translation. However, this view was also abandoned, and the preference reverted to the original English text.

The Ministry of Justice issued several bulletins at different times to correct some errors in the translation, and a committee consisting of professors from the law faculty, judges, and lawyers was assigned to produce a new official translation which was authorized for publication and declared to be the official translation that must be followed. Afterward, the ministry reversed its stance and stated that the first Arabic translation is the binding official text that cannot be changed.

The judicial interpretation of the Penal Code and the various conflicting positions regarding it remain subject to different opinions. It is evident that this situation causes confusion and creates ambiguity in the application of one of the most important branches of the law.

Furthermore, the Baghdad Penal Code was incomplete in terms of its general and specific provisions. While it covered civil matters that are not within the scope of criminal law and imposed penalties on matters beyond the concept of crime, it included specific provisions on the execution of penalties, which should rightfully fall under the Criminal Procedure Code.

Considering all these factors, sound legislative policy dictates that laws and regulations should be constantly developed and revised in any country to keep up with the evolving circumstances of its society resulting from economic changes, achieving civilized progress, and adapting to changing social relationships. This development allows the legal system to meet the needs of a progressive society and the requirements of a changing life, preventing gaps from forming between societal conditions and the legal system if the laws remain static without renewal.When the matter was on the track that has been mentioned, it became necessary to substitute the Baghdadi Penal Code with a new law that aligned with the modern life of a renewed society like the Iraqi society. This urgent need was voiced by many, not only within the judiciary and law enforcement circles, nor only within the academic and jurisprudential circles, but also within various other fields and sectors of the Iraqi society. Under the pressure of this urgent need to legislate a new penal code that aligns with the spirit of the times and the needs of the society, and that fills the many gaps in the Baghdadi Penal Code, multiple attempts were made to legislate a new penal code. The Ministry of Justice called upon committees for this purpose and drafted bills, repeating this process many times since the year 1121 until recent years. The latest complete draft of the penal code was prepared in the year 1157, but none of the previous bills were enacted, until the issuance of our current law, which has been published, thereby putting an end to the existence of the Baghdadi Penal Code that was established by the British occupation authority fifty-nine years ago. 

In preparing the principles and provisions of this law, we considered achieving the objectives that criminal laws aim for, as indicated by criminal studies. This encompasses juristic opinions, specialized academic research, judicial rulings, recommendations from Arab, regional, and international conferences, along with the facts and opinions provided by the auxiliary sciences of criminal law. We employed all of this in constructing the principles, provisions, and articles of this law, all within the framework of the reality of the Iraqi society that this law is meant to be applied within. We made it a priority for the provisions of the law to be commensurate with their necessity, while also being in line with the conditions of the society and its social and economic relationships, as they aspire to progress, development, and constantly strive for a better life. 

To achieve these advanced objectives, we took into account the practices, stance, and rulings of the Iraqi judiciary regarding the cases ought to be addressed by this law. We also examined the provisions of the punitive laws applied in Iraq for many years, as well as referenced the drafts of punitive laws seeking to be enacted. We also studied the penal codes in other countries, especially Arab ones, due to the similarity in social conditions between them and Iraq, and in accordance with the principle of unifying judgments and terminology in Arab countries to the best of our abilities. We also referred to certain foreign penal laws for illuminating guidance in the subject matter to be governed by Iraqi law. 

This law, therefore, came to light after considering these initiatory reasons in order to be comprehensive and accurate. Scientifically, it was developed and structured in a well-organized manner, coherent in its provisions with no contradictions, in accordance with the principles and judgments, with clear language that facilitates the understanding of its texts and the perception of its objectives, not only by legal professionals but by ordinary citizens as well, without the need for juristic expertise. It is responsive to other legislation, such as civil law, civil and commercial procedural law, commercial law, company law, and criminal procedural law, complementing the shortcomings revealed in the application of the Baghdadi Penal Code, which necessitated avoiding them as elaborated in the explanatory memorandum. 

These are the justifying reasons that led to the legislation of this law and its publication, so that it will come into effect three months after its publication in the official gazette. This period was determined to allow citizens to read it, judges to study it, and everyone to have access to it. When it goes into effect after the three month period, the Baghdadi Penal Code and its amendments will be abolished. Any penal text in any law that clearly or implicitly conflicts with the provisions of this law will be nullified.
